[11:15:43 PM] Ninja: AvailablePlugin?
[11:16:25 PM] Ninja: Yeah, that's the danger of using ArrayList
[11:16:30 PM] Ninja: you can throw any type in there
[11:17:02 PM] Ninja: I'd prefer a System.Collections.Generic.List(Of SilverMonkey.Interfaces.msPlugin)
[11:17:34 PM] Ninja: Or perhaps a System.Collections.Immutable.ImmutableArray(Of SilverMonkey.Interfaces.msPlugin)
[11:17:53 PM] Ninja: That would shift the exception to where you add it to the list
[11:17:58 PM] Ninja: and shine a bit more light on this
[11:18:09 PM] Gerolkae .: ah ok... I leard the art of llists after that code was written
[11:18:13 PM] Ninja: Might even become apparent if it triggers compiler errors
[11:18:43 PM] Ninja: (ImmutableArray can be found in the nuget package System.Collections.Immutable by Microsoft.)
[11:19:16 PM] Ninja: Still reading through PluginServices.vb
