    ''' This system mirrors Furcadia's banish system by tracking the banish
    ''' commands sent to the game aerver and keep a list of banished furres
    ''' locally. To help keep the list accurate, It is reconmended to ask
    ''' the server for a banish list upon joining the dream. It maybe a good
    ''' idea to run a daily schedule to refresh the list for temp banishes
