Causes=These are the initial event triggers, what starts any given event block.
Additional Conditions=Extra conditions to decide if a given event block will run. These use an AND logic - all of them must be true for the event to cause an effect.
Areas=Areas focus effects to a specific section of the map. Only one can be active at a time - subsequent Area lines will replace the earlier one. For easier positioning, Rectangle areas take the coordinates used by the Map editor's select tool.
Filters=Filters focus effects yet farther, allowing you to change only places that have (or do not have) specific floors, objects, or if the spaces can be walked on or not. You may use more than one filter at a time - they do stack.
Effects=Effects are how you actually make something happen after all the conditions have been met.
