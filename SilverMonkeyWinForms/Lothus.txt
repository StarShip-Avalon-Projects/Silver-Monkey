Okay. First, to MS_Engine, I added

    Public callbk As Main

Right after the module declaration. Second, in Main.LoadLibrary, I added

MS_Engine.callbk = Me

right after "If MS_Started() Then Exit Sub"... and third, this is now MS_Engine.SayLibrary.sendServer.

        Sub sendServer(ByRef var As String)
            callbk.sndServer(var)
        End Sub
