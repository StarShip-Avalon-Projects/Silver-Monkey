-Read Default URLs
- Seperate Furcadia Proxy/firewall settings update into its own object with Mutex to 
  prevent Other FurcLib Apps from overriding Settings during connection
- Add optional settings list. (Preload with defaults)

ADD TLS/SSL support  (See Protocol Fragmentation)

1: Look for the application folder for localdir.ini
2: Read Localdir.ini for Furcadia install path...
3: If those fail... Fall back to searching defalut paths...
3a: Look for Furcadia's localdir.ini
